About Seam Patched
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This project is provided to distribute Seam v2.0.2 with a patch that was
not accepted into Seam Core until 2.1.

The patch is described here:

https://jira.jboss.org/jira/browse/JBSEAM-3097

Basically it allows HibernatePersistenceProvider/ManagedHibernateSession
to correctly pass a collection of values to the underlying filter.

In the spirit of not requiring people to upgrade their underlying version
of Seam for their applications to take advantage of this feature (which
could cause regression errors in non-trivial applications), we have released
this patched version of Seam v2.0.2.SP1 for your convenience.
